## üó£Ô∏è Voice Related Commands and Info
- This bot is able to hear all of the users in a voice channel. So in order to play or control the music, you don't have to use the slash commands, and instead you can your voice as a command.
By default, "venus" is the keyword to activate this, and these are the available voice commands:
```
'venus play', 'venus skip', 'venus next', 'venus loop', 'venus pause', 'venus stop'
```
While "venus" is the default keyword to activate these commands, you can actually change this word to something else, or even to multiple keywords.
### /keywords
- This command will show all of the available keywords you can use as a voice command, from here you can also add or remove certain keywords.
### Example Usage:

- Since this bot can listen to the users in a voice channel, I also added the ability for it to keep track of certain words being said.
### /counters
With this command, you will be able to see all of the keywords and word counters. You can also add or remove keywords/counters from this menu. 
- Counters are words that are being tracked.
- Keywords are words that will track towards a counter. You can have multiple keywords point to a counter.
### Example Usage:

### /transcribe
This command allows you to transcribe the audio from all users in a voice channel to a specified text channel. If no channel is specified, it will turn off transcribing.

## Smart Connect
- While the bot is in 24/7 mode, the bot will join the channel when you join, or it will leave when it is the last one left in the channel.

## ‚ú® Basic Command Usage and Examples
### /247
Connect the bot to a voice channel and set it to 24/7 mode. The bot will leave when it's the last one in the call, and it'll join when someone enters the call. all other commands that play music also activate 24/7 mode if the user is in a voice channel.
